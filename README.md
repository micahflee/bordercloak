# BorderCloak

If you have data you would like to keep private, one of the most dangerous places to carry it with you is while you're crossing a border. You run the risk of getting detained, and getting your devices confiscated. And even if you use disk encryption, the attackeres might be capable of sophisticated password attacks and brute force attacks against your crypto to steal your data.

But there is solution that's both simple and extremely inconventient: Before you leave, encrypt the data you need for your trip and upload it to the Internet. Travel with an empty computer. When you arrive on the other side of the border, download and decrypt your data.

BorderCloak aims to make this solution more convenient.
